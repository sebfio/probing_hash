# Linear Probing Hashes

Made to make my other projects easier with symbol tables

### TODO
- Unit tests
- Test with valgrind
- Set up CI
- write makefile

### Objectives
- work for a variety of data structures and key types
- allow the user to modify values
- not lose your data (unit tests)

### Constraints
- Usually forces you to make your own hash functions
- The _default_ int and string hashes have heap keys
- The _default_ int and string hashes **do not** control hash values
